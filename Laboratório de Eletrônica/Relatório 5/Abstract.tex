\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
This report, studied and implemented the application of transistors for fixed biasing circuits, as well as the collection of experimental values of operating points. Theoretical analysis were also performed for comparison between experimental values and theoretical values. \\
 \noindent
 \textbf{Keyword}: transistor, tbj, fixed polarization
