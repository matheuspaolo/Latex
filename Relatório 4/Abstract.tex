\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
This report studied and implemented the application of capacitors and Zener diodes for grinding circuits, as well as the collection and analysis of different forms of waves generated by these circuits. Theoretical analysis were also performed for comparison between experimental values and the theoretical values. \\
 \noindent
 \textbf{Keyword}: capacitor, rectificier circuit, Zener diode
