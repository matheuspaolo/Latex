\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
This report studied and implemented the application of diodes and transformers for grinding circuits, as well as the collection and analysis of different forms of waves generated by these circuits. Simulations were also performed through the Multisim software for comparison between the experimental values and the values obtained in the simulation.
